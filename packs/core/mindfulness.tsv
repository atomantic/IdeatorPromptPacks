moments today when I felt present
thoughts I can let go of
sensations I'm noticing right now
breathing exercises to try
meditation techniques to explore
ways to ground myself when anxious
mindful activities for this week
triggers I want to be aware of
intentions for tomorrow
types of peaceful environments I enjoy
