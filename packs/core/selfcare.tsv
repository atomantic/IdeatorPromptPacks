activities that recharge my energy
boundaries I need to set
comfort activities for bad days
lessons I've learned in the last year
positive affirmations I need to hear
rest activities that aren't sleep
self-care rituals to establish
ways to celebrate small wins
ways to pamper myself this weekend
ways to say no without guilt
