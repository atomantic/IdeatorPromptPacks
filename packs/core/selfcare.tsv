ways to pamper myself this weekend
boundaries I need to set
self-care rituals to establish
activities that recharge my energy
ways to say no without guilt
comfort activities for bad days
positive affirmations I need to hear
ways to celebrate small wins
self-compassion practices to try
rest activities that aren't sleep
