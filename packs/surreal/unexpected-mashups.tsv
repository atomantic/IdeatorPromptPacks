collisions of fairy tales and corporate culture
combinations of natural phenomena and machinery
crossovers of weather patterns and emotions

merges of board games and wilderness survival
mixes of sports and performing arts
pairings of everyday objects with cosmic functions
stories blending mythical creatures with sci-fi settings
