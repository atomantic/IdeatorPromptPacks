mashups of historical events with modern tech
stories blending mythical creatures with sci-fi settings
fusion of cuisines from incompatible cultures
mixes of sports and performing arts
hybrids of musical genres and architectural styles
combinations of natural phenomena and machinery
pairings of everyday objects with cosmic functions
collisions of fairy tales and corporate culture
crossovers of weather patterns and emotions
merges of board games and wilderness survival
