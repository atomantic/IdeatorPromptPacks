rules for worlds with shifting gravity
forms of communication beyond human senses
technologies powered by emotions
cities that grow like living organisms
societies governed by children
systems where identity is assigned by nature
space travel using unexpected materials
economies that trade in dreams
landscapes sculpted by music
timelines with daily seasonal cycles
