a world where gravity changes direction every hour
a universe where people communicate via flavors instead of words
a timeline where technology is powered by emotions
a planet where seasons occur every day
a society that swaps dreams instead of goods
a city where architecture grows like plants
a world ruled by children over one hundred years old
a reality where identities are assigned by the wind
a civilization navigating space with giant soap bubbles
a dimension where music constructs physical objects
