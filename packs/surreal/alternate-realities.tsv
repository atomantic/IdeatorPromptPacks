cities that grow like living organisms
economies that trade in dreams
forms of communication beyond human senses
landscapes sculpted by music
rules for worlds with shifting gravity
societies governed by children
space travel using unexpected materials
systems where identity is assigned by nature
technologies powered by emotions
timelines with daily seasonal cycles
