Gadgets powered by impossible energy sources	(source + delightful hazard)
Household items that function in dreams	(works only while you sleep)
Inventions that transform emotions into matter	(feeling → material + side effect)
Machines built from intangible materials	(what it’s made of + failure mode)
Personal assistants with bizarre limitations	(useful but hilariously specific constraints)
Sensors tuned to imaginary phenomena	(detects X; false positives are Y)
Transportation modes that ignore physics	(rule broken + one rule kept)
Wearable tech with surreal side effects	(benefit + embarrassing quirk)
