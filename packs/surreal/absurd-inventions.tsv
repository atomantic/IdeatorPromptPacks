appliances that alter reality when used
devices that obey contradictory commands
gadgets powered by impossible energy sources
household items that function in dreams
inventions that transform emotions into matter
machines built from intangible materials
personal assistants with bizarre limitations
sensors tuned to imaginary phenomena
transportation modes that ignore physics
wearable tech with surreal side effects
