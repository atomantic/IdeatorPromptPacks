gadgets powered by impossible energy sources
wearable tech with surreal side effects
household tools that function only in dreams
machines built from intangible materials
devices that obey contradictory commands
inventions that transform emotions into matter
transportation modes that ignore physics
sensors tuned to imaginary phenomena
appliances that alter reality when used
personal assistants with bizarre limitations
