appliances that alter reality when used	(every use exacts a small cost)
devices that obey contradictory commands	(works only when told not to)
gadgets powered by impossible energy sources	(source + delightful hazard)
household items that function in dreams	(works only while you sleep)
inventions that transform emotions into matter	(feeling → material + side effect)
machines built from intangible materials	(what it’s made of + failure mode)
personal assistants with bizarre limitations	(useful but hilariously specific constraints)
sensors tuned to imaginary phenomena	(detects X; false positives are Y)
transportation modes that ignore physics	(rule broken + one rule kept)
wearable tech with surreal side effects	(benefit + embarrassing quirk)
