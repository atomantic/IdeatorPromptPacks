describe Earth from the viewpoint of a curious asteroid
a love poem written by a sentient nebula
instructions for humans from an extraterrestrial barista
a diary entry of a shapeshifting tourist
a letter home from a microscopic alien living in a droplet of water
a manifesto of a peaceful invasion by plant-based beings
a conversation between two comets about human art
a recipe book for cooking emotions
an alien child's explanation of laughter
the first handshake between humans and a swarm intelligence
