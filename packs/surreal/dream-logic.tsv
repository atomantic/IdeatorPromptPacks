a staircase that loops back to your childhood memory
a conversation with a mirror that refuses to reflect you
a library where books write the reader
an ocean made of liquid neon and floating islands of silence
time flows backward whenever someone laughs
a forest where trees whisper forgotten words
a door that opens to a song instead of a room
a city built on top of sleeping giants
a pet cloud that follows you indoors
each sunset rearranges the constellations
