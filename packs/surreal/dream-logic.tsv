events that happen before their causes
conversations with objects that have opinions
places that morph based on thoughts
rules that change whenever attention shifts
journeys where destinations chase travelers
time moving differently for each person
encounters with symbolic versions of people
dreams nested inside other dreams
relationships defined by surreal metaphors
maps that redraw themselves as you move
