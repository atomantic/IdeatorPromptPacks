conversations with objects that have opinions
dreams nested inside other dreams
encounters with symbolic versions of people
events that happen before their causes
journeys where destinations chase travelers
maps that redraw themselves as you move
places that morph based on thoughts
relationships defined by surreal metaphors
rules that change whenever attention shifts
time moving differently for each person
