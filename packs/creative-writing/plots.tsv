plot twists no one would see coming
subplots to weave into the main story
ways to raise the stakes
cliffhanger endings for chapters
opening scenes that hook readers
obstacles to throw at my protagonist
red herrings to mislead readers
ways to foreshadow the ending
midpoint reversals to consider
climax scenarios for my story
stories that start at the ending
conflicts based on misunderstood messages
villains with noble goals
journeys that happen entirely in dreams
plots driven by an impossible choice
tales where the setting is alive
mysteries solved by children
romances that span decades
adventures sparked by a random note
narratives told backward
